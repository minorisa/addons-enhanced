The purchase request workflow starts creating a draft request. When the user 
pushes the <strong>Send</strong> button, an email is sent to user's supervisor seeking his/her approval. The supervisor 
or validator will accept or deny that purchase request. If accepted, a Purchase Order may be generated. If that 
Purchase Order is deleted, the purchase request will return to <strong>Accepted</strong> state.
